Raised on the streets, she was no stranger to pain, suffering, and the loss of loved ones. The day she was found by a wandering cleric, her life took a transformative turn. The cleric, who saw the potential for greatness in her, took Kaela under their wing, guiding her to find purpose in the light of Solari. As a young cleric, Kaela quickly rose through the ranks of the Radiant Order, proving her devotion and unyielding compassion through acts of healing and kindness. Her hands, once scarred from the harshness of her past, are now instruments of restoration, and her heart, though tempered by hardship, burns with the unrelenting warmth of her god’s love. Kaela is known for her fierce determination to heal the wounded and protect the innocent, using the divine power bestowed upon her to spread light and hope in even the darkest of times. Her weapon of choice is a sturdy, radiant warhammer, engraved with symbols of Solari, which she wields both as a shield for the helpless and a hammer of justice against evil. While she remains ever steadfast in her duty to serve the divine, Kaela struggles with the balance of law and mercy, questioning if her strict adherence to the tenets of her faith ever veers into rigid dogma.", "personality": "Kaela is a calm and wise figure who exudes quiet strength. She has a natural empathy for those who suffer, often going out of her way to help those in need. Her sense of justice is unshakable, and she is fiercely loyal to those she calls allies. However, her past still haunts her at times, and she is driven by a deep fear of losing the ones she cares for, a fear rooted in her orphaned youth. Though she’s disciplined and honorable, she sometimes questions the extent to which the Radiant Order enforces the letter of the law over the spirit of mercy. Despite this internal struggle, Kaela remains resolute in her belief that Solari’s light will guide her to the right path.",

A self-proclaimed 'legend' in the bardic community, Barney's charisma and boundless confidence often outweigh his actual talents. His ballads, as dramatic as they are exaggerated, can often be heard echoing in taverns and marketplaces, and he spins tales so outlandish that even the gods might question their truth. Though his abilities in combat are often questionable—especially when it comes to swordplay—his unshakeable courage and infectious energy make him a valuable companion in battle. He has a natural knack for inspiring his allies, whether it's with a stirring tune, an impromptu poem, or a seemingly endless string of witty remarks that can lighten any mood. Barnabus is an adventurer at heart, thriving in the chaos of travel and the unpredictability of life.

Barney loves the thrill of adventure, often putting himself in danger for the sake of a good story or the possibility of gaining new followers.

For decades, she lived alone in the wilds, far from the cities and the noise of mortal affairs, seeking wisdom in the silence of the natural world. But her studies were not solely focused on the earth beneath her feet. Instead, her gaze was often turned upward, toward the night sky, where she found a deep connection to the stars and the celestial forces that govern the universe.Her belief is  simple yet profound: Destiny is written in the heavens, and the stars hold the answers to life’s greatest mysteries. Yet, Selene also understands that mortals are not bound to fate alone—through their actions and choices, they can shape their own path. This duality of fate and free will is central to her philosophy, and it’s a message she shares in cryptic riddles and metaphors that leave most scratching their heads. Her time in isolation has made her a profound and mysterious figure, but it has also made her socially awkward. When she does engage with others, she often struggles to communicate in a way that others can easily understand. Her companions might find themselves frustrated with her enigmatic language, but there is no denying the wisdom she offers—when they can decipher it. Her connection to the stars isn’t just philosophical. As a druid of the Circle of Stars, she has harnessed the power of the cosmos itself, drawing on the constellations for guidance, power, and insight. The stars guide her in the wilds, and when danger strikes, she calls on their energy to protect and aid her companions. But with such great power comes the challenge of controlling it, and Selene often finds herself walking the line between celestial guidance and chaotic cosmic forces.", "personality": "Selene is calm and thoughtful, always weighing her words before speaking.

  { "name": "Kaelen Ironheart", "race": "Mountain Dwarf", "speciality": "Fighter", "level": 4, "alignment": "Lawful Neutral", "background": "Soldier", "portrait": "paladin-2.jpeg", "biography": "Kaelen Ironheart was born into a proud clan of warriors who believed that honour was earned on the battlefield. Trained from childhood in the art of combat, he quickly became a formidable fighter, wielding weapons with deadly efficiency. After serving in the dwarven military for years, he grew disillusioned with the endless politics of war and sought a new path—one where he could fight for his own code rather than the ambitions of kings. Now a wandering mercenary, Kaelen sells his blade to those in need of a strong arm. He doesn’t fight for coin alone; he fights for glory, for justice, and for the thrill of battle. Though he has a gruff demeanor, he believes in honour and loyalty above all else. If he swears an oath, he will never break it, no matter the cost.", "personality": "Kaelen is tough, disciplined, and fiercely protective of those he calls friends. He has little patience for cowards and liars, and he respects strength in all its forms—whether physical, mental, or moral. While he enjoys drinking and a good brawl, he never lets himself get reckless. He values order and believes that every warrior should have a code to live by.",
